# Hate Speech Detection
The main aim of this project is to classify tweets in three classes:<br>
  (1) Hate Speech<br>
  (2) Offensive Language<br>
  (3) No Hate speech No offensive language<br><br>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <br>
   <b> The final model's performance is indicative of the two major roadblocks of the project:</b><br><br>
    (1) The massive class imbalance of the dataset.<br>
    (2) The model's inability to "unerstand" the nuances of hate speech.<br><br>
The issue of class imbalance is manageable with preprocessing techniques and oversampling/undersampling techniques. However, identifying hate speech is an overall problem that many major tech companies like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram are still struggling with.
